# Weather Data Collector

## Project Overview
This project collects real-time weather data using the OpenWeather API and stores it in a Google Sheet. The data includes temperature, humidity, weather description, and other useful details about cities. It consists of two main components:

- **`weather_data_collector.ipynb`**: A Jupyter notebook that collects weather data for various cities and appends it to a Google Sheet.
- **`weather_bot.ipynb`**: A Jupyter notebook that lets the user interact with the collected weather data and query it through a chatbot-like interface.
